# Service Oriented Architecture vs Microservices

## Service Oriented Architecture (SoA)

> Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is a method of software development that uses software components called services to create business applications. Each service provides a business capability, and services can also communicate with each other across platforms and languages.
>
> Service interfaces are defined by using web service definition language (WSDL) xml document
>
> The services are exposed by using standard network protocolsâ€”such as simple object access protocol (SOAP)/HTTP or Restful HTTP (JSON/HTTP)
>
> Services are published in a registry that enables developers to quickly find them

## Difference between SoA & Microservices

> Microservices architecture is an application architectural style and an application-scoped concept. It enables the internals of a single application to be broken up into small pieces that can be independently changed, scaled and administered.
