# SQL vs NoSQL 

This document is prepared by compiling information from multiple learning platforms. Its only for ready reference purpose

| RDBMS  | NoSQL |
|---|---|
|Schema design & normalization is important | In NoSQL, Schema is designed based on the access patterns
|Tables can be extended in future | Understanding the business problems and the application use cases up front is essential 
| No problem on number of tables | should maintain as few tables as possible |

 > Instead of reshaping data when a query is processed (as an RDBMS system does), a NoSQL database organizes data so that its shape in the database corresponds with what will be queried - From AWS Documentation
